This application shows number of people of top 5 nationalites according to chosen university.

Here is [my shiny app](https://gulhandemireldilek.shinyapps.io/students_nationalities/)

Here is the command line:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
shiny::runGitHub("pjournal/mef06-glhndmrl",
                 subdir="Foreign_Students_by_Nationality_Homework/")
```
